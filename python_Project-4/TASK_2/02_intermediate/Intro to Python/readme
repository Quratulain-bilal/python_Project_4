🌍🚀 Planetary Weight Calculator 🌌
📜 Description
Ever wondered how much you'd weigh on different planets? This Python program helps you calculate your weight on Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune based on Earth's gravity. Just enter your weight and choose a planet!

⚡ How It Works
1️⃣ Run the program in Python.
2️⃣ Enter your weight (in kg).
3️⃣ Choose a planet from the list.
4️⃣ Get your weight on that planet! 🎉

🛠 How to Run the Program
✅ Step 1: Install Python
Make sure Python is installed on your system. If not, download it here.

✅ Step 2: Save the Script
Save the following code as planetary_weight.py:

python
Copy
Edit
# Planetary Weight Calculator 🌍🚀
# Enter your weight and get your weight on other planets! 🌌

# Gravity constants relative to Earth's gravity 🌎
PLANET_GRAVITY = {
    "Mercury": 0.376,
    "Venus": 0.889,
    "Mars": 0.378,
    "Jupiter": 2.36,
    "Saturn": 1.081,
    "Uranus": 0.815,
    "Neptune": 1.14,
    "Earth": 1.0
}

def main():
    # Get user input 📩
    earth_weight = float(input("Enter your weight on Earth (kg): "))
    planet = input("Enter a planet name (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune): ")

    # Check if planet exists in dictionary
    if planet in PLANET_GRAVITY:
        # Calculate equivalent weight on chosen planet
        planetary_weight = round(earth_weight * PLANET_GRAVITY[planet], 2)
        print(f"✨ Your weight on {planet}: {planetary_weight} kg ✨")
    else:
        print("❌ Invalid planet name! Please enter a valid planet.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
✅ Step 3: Run the Program
Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python planetary_weight.py
🎯 Example Usage
📌 Example 1
nginx
Copy
Edit
Enter your weight on Earth (kg): 120
Enter a planet name (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune): Mars
✨ Your weight on Mars: 45.36 kg ✨
📌 Example 2
nginx
Copy
Edit
Enter your weight on Earth (kg): 150
Enter a planet name (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune): Jupiter
✨ Your weight on Jupiter: 354.0 kg ✨
🔥 Features
✅ Simple & easy-to-use interface 🖥
✅ Supports 7 planets 🌎
✅ Accurate weight conversion ⚖
✅ Error handling for incorrect inputs ❌

💡 Notes
The program only accepts planets with the first letter capitalized (e.g., Mars instead of mars).

We assume input weight is in kilograms (kg).

🎲 Random Number Generator
Welcome to the Random Number Generator project! This Python program generates and displays a sequence of random numbers, offering flexibility in the quantity and range of numbers produced.

📝 Overview
The program utilizes Python's built-in random module to generate a specified number of random integers within a defined range. By default, it produces 10 random numbers between 1 and 100, but these parameters can be adjusted as needed.

🚀 Features
Customizable Output: Specify the number of random numbers to generate.
Flexible Range: Define the range (start and end) for the random numbers.
User-Friendly Display: Outputs the random numbers in a single line, separated by spaces.
🛠️ How It Works
Function Definition:

generate_random_numbers(count, start, end): Generates a list of random integers based on the provided parameters:
count: Number of random numbers to generate.
start: Lower bound of the range (inclusive).
end: Upper bound of the range (inclusive).
Main Execution:

Calls the generate_random_numbers() function with default parameters.
Prints the generated numbers in a single line, separated by spaces.
📋 Requirements
Python 3.x
▶️ Usage
Clone or Download the repository containing the script.

Navigate to the directory containing the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd /path/to/directory
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python random_number_generator.py
Output:

The program will display a line of random numbers. For example:
arduino
Copy
Edit
Generated random numbers:
45 79 61 47 52 10 16 83 19 12
🔧 Customization
To modify the number of random numbers generated or to change the range:

Open the script in a text editor.

Adjust the parameters in the generate_random_numbers() function call within the main() function:

python
Copy
Edit
def main():
    random_numbers = generate_random_numbers(count=15, start=50, end=150)
    print("Generated random numbers:")
    print(" ".join(map(str, random_numbers)))
In this example:

count=15: Generates 15 random numbers.
start=50: Lower bound is set to 50.
end=150: Upper bound is set to 150.
Save the changes and run the script as described above.

📚 Learning Points
Random Number Generation: Utilizing Python's random.randint() function to produce random integers within a specified range.
List Comprehension: Efficiently generating a list of random numbers.
String Manipulation: Formatting and displaying the list of numbers as a space-separated string.
